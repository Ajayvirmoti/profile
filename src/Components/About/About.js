Hi, my name is
Brittany Chiang.
I build things for the web.

I‚Äôm a software engineer specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences. Currently, I‚Äôm focused on building accessible, human-centered products at Upstatement.
Check out my course!
About Me

Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes ‚Äî turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

Fast-forward to today, and I‚Äôve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.

I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.

Here are a few technologies I‚Äôve been working with recently:

JavaScript (ES6+)
TypeScript
React
Eleventy
Node.js
WordPress

Featured Project
Build a Spotify Connected App

Having struggled with understanding how the Spotify OAuth flow works, I made the course I wish I could have had.

Unlike tutorials that only cover a few concepts and leave you with half-baked GitHub repositories, this course covers everything from explaining the principles of REST APIs to implementing Spotify's OAuth flow and fetching API data in a React app. By the end of the course, you‚Äôll have an app deployed to the internet you can add to your portfolio.
